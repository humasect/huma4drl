1. You need a Common Lisp implementation.
   Only tested on SBCL right now.

2. Then link the gamelike.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   mkdir ~/.sbcl
   mkdir ~/.sbcl/systems
   ln -s ~/src/huma4drl/gamelike.asd ~/.sbcl/systems

3. At the shell, cd to the the directory with this file, run SBCL, and
   then at the REPL, type:

    (require :gamelike)
    (gamelike:output-all)
